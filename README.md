School project whose goals are to render some of the school's furniture pieces in low-poly using WebGL.

## Features to implement
* Render a classroom furniture including:
    * Tables
    * Chairs
* Render the furniture using as few polygons as possible (low-poly)
* Pieces of furniture must be in a file format which is reusable for others projects: `.obj`

## Technics
The followings infography technics might be used:
* Billboard Clouds

## Tools
Here are the tools (libraries or software) that will be used for this project:
* 3D Computer Graphics softwares such as Blender, 3DsMax, etc. for billboard design
* WebGL library for in-browser 3D rendeging
* Aaron Boman's [webgl-obj-loader](https://github.com/frenchtoast747/webgl-obj-loader) Javascript `.obj` files loader library
